      <p>The logo was designed for Africa Rhythms Safaris to reflect the vibrant culture and adventurous spirit of their safari experiences. I created this design to capture the essence of Africa's natural beauty and wildlife while highlighting the rhythmic, cultural elements unique to the continent. 
        The warm colors and dynamic imagery aim to appeal to a wide audience, showcasing the excitement and environmental richness of the safari adventures offered.

      On the second logo I chose the design because it brings the Kenyan aspect and identity of Kenyan print that is not biased to one tribe over another is developing both socially and economically at a high and forward rate.
      A modern society in the works. Also was inspired by the self-made saying “you can take the Kenyan out of Kenya but you cannot take the Kenyan out of a Kenyan”
      I picked a modern font that represented the urbane culture white color to represent peace and black to stand for people</p>
